            Welcome to my professional portfolio. I'm Manisha Basnet, a Samsung Experience Consultant based in Gorkha, Nepal. My journey in customer service and technology began with a passion for connecting people with solutions that enhance their daily lives.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            With a background in Business Studies from Drabya Shah Multiple Campus, I've developed a strong foundation in understanding customer needs and business operations. Since October 2023, I've been working with Samsung through Rolling Plans Pvt. Ltd., where I specialize in guiding customers through Samsung's diverse product ecosystem.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            My approach combines technical product knowledge with interpersonal skills to create meaningful customer connections. I believe that exceptional customer service goes beyond simply explaining featuresâ€”it's about understanding needs, solving problems, and building relationships.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            As technology continues to evolve rapidly, I remain committed to staying current with the latest advancements and helping customers navigate an increasingly complex digital landscape. I take pride in my ability to translate technical information into practical advice that empowers customers to make confident decisions.
